# ðŸ§± Prototype Project

A scalable, modular microservice architecture built with **Bun.js**, **Express**, **Mongoose**, **Kafka**, and **Docker Compose**. Designed for rapid prototyping, robust logging, and seamless observability across services.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Modular Microservices**: Each service is isolated, configurable, and independently deployable.
- **Advanced Logging**: Millisecond-precision logs with Winston, supporting local and remote targets via `.env` toggles.
- **Kafka Integration**: Event-driven communication with Kafdrop UI for monitoring.
- **MongoDB Stack**: Includes Mongo Express for quick DB inspection.
- **Docker Orchestration**: Healthchecks, timezone consistency, and service dependency management.
- **Environment Flexibility**: Cross-platform support with mounted host timezone files.
