# üß™ Prototype Project

![License: All Rights Reserved](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-All%20Rights%20Reserved-red.svg)
![Kafka: WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kafka-WIP-orange)

Prototype Project is a **scalable microservice-based architecture** built with **Bun.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Docker Compose**, with planned integration of **Kafka** and additional distributed services.  
This repository is designed as a foundation for building **modular, event-driven systems** with a focus on:
- üöÄ **Rapid prototyping** for new ideas.  
- üì° **Extensibility** to add new services without breaking existing ones.  
- üèó **Scalability** to support future workloads and cloud-native deployment.  
- üîé **Observability** through centralized logging, monitoring, and service discovery.  

Future roadmap includes more microservices (inventory, notifications, analytics), deeper Kafka event streaming, and full observability stack integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Microservices**
  - `auth-service` ‚Üí Handles user authentication (login, register, logout).
  - `logger-service` ‚Üí Centralized logging service with DB persistence and query APIs.
  - `api-gateway-service` ‚Üí Single entry point, proxies requests to microservices.
- **Advanced Logging**
  - Millisecond-precision logs with Winston.
  - Remote log storage in MongoDB via `logger-service`.
- **Kafka Integration** ![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-orange)
  - Event-driven communication for extensibility.
  - Kafdrop UI for monitoring topics & partitions.
- **MongoDB Stack**
  - Includes **Mongo Express** for quick DB inspection.
- **Docker Orchestration**
  - Healthchecks, dependencies, and timezone consistency across containers.
- **Environment Flexibility**
  - Cross-platform `.env` support with mounted host timezone files.

## üìä Observability

* **Mongo Express** ‚Üí [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
* **Kafdrop (Kafka UI)** ‚Üí [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) ![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-orange)

---

## üõ† Development Notes

* All services respect `.env` configs (ports, DB URIs, log endpoints).
* `logger-service` should **start first**, then dependent services (`auth-service`, `api-gateway-service`).
* The gateway handles **service discovery** internally via Docker network aliases.
* Kafka integration is under development ![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-orange) ‚Äî not all event-driven features may work yet.
